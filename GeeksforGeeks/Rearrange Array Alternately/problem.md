## Rearrange Array Alternately
**Medium**
Given a sorted array of positive integers. Your task is to rearrange  the array elements alternatively i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on.

**Your Task:**  
The task is to complete the function  **rearrange**() which rearranges elements as explained above. Printing of the modified array will be handled by driver code.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

**Constraints:**  
1 <= N <= 107  
1 <= arr[i] <= 107
